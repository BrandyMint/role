# jquery.role â€” jQuery plugin to provide easy way to handle DOM elements by role attribute

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for release numbering.

Sponsored by [Evil Martians](http://evilmartians.com/).

## Idea behind this piece of code

I start using role attrbute (`<div role="role_name"></div>`) to handle DOM elements.

![Y U NO USE CLASSES?](https://github.com/kossnocorp/role/raw/master/doc/yuno.png)

Some reasons:

* Markup-guys always change classes and class names (and this is ok)
* It's hard to know this class is used for JavaScript or not?
* And finally: semantic

## Usage

### Using selectors

You can use symbol '@' in jQuery selectors to find elements with roles

Will select all elements in document with `role="ajax-link"`:

``` js
$('@ajax-link');
``

`<form role="login_form"></form>`:

``` js
$('form@login_form');
```

`<form class="dark" role="login_form"></form>`:

``` js
$('form.dark@login_form');
```

`<form class="dark" role="login_form" method="post"></form>`:

``` js
$('form.dark@login_form[method=post]');
```

`<form class="dark" role="login_form ajax_form" method="post"></form>`:

``` js
$('form.dark@login_form@ajax_form[method=post]');
```
