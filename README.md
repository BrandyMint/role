# jquery.role â€” jQuery plugin to provide easy way to handle DOM elements by role attribute

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for release numbering.

Sponsored by [Evil Martians](http://evilmartians.com/).

## Idea behind this piece of code

I start using role attrbute (`<div role="role_name"></div>`) to handle DOM elements.

![Y U NO USE CLASSES?](https://github.com/kossnocorp/role/raw/master/doc/yuno.png)

Some reasons:

* Markup-guys always change classes and class names (and this is normally)
* It's hard to know this class is used for JavaScript or not?
* And finally: semantic

But what wrong with id's? Isn't usage of id's is more faster than class or attributes?

Id is ok, but it uses for styles to. So why not use prefix? For example `role-id_name`.

## Usage

### Using selectors

You can use symbol '@' in jQuery selectors to find elements with roles

``` javascript
$('@ajax-link'); // Will select all elements in document with role="ajax-link"
$('form@login_form'); // <form role="login_form"></form>
$('form.dark@login_form'); // <form class="dark" role="login_form"></form>
$('form.dark@login_form[method=post]'); // <form class="dark" role="login_form" method="post"></form>
$('form.dark@login_form@ajax_form[method=post]'); // <form class="dark" role="login_form ajax_form" method="post"></form>
etc...
```

### Basic (WARNING: basic ($.r) functional is deprecated and will be completely removed in 0.4.0)

``` javascript
$.role('login_form'); // To handle <form role="login_form"></form>
```

or via alias `$.r`:

``` javascript
$.r('login_form');
```

### Pick by element id

``` javascript
$.r('#login_form'); // To handle <form id="role-login_form"></form>
```

### With context

``` javascript
$.r('submit', loginForm); // To handle <a href="#" role="submit"></a> inside loginForm element
```

## Roadmap

* Optional usage of `data-role` instead `role`.
