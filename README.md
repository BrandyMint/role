# jquery.role â€” jQuery plugin to provide easy way to handle DOM elements by role attribute

## Idea behind this piece of code

I start using role attrbute (`<div role=""></div>`) to handle DOM elements.

![Y U NO USE CLASSES?](https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.role/raw/master/doc/yuno.png)

Some reasons:

* Markup-guys always change classes and class names (and this is normally)
* It's hard to know this class is used for JavaScript or not?
* And finally: semantic

But what wrong with id's? Isn't usage of id's is more faster than class or attributes?

* TODO: Die hard reason #1
* TODO: Die hard reason #2
* TODO: Die hard reason #3

## Usage

### Basic

``` javascript
$.role('login_form'); // To handle <form role="login_form"></form>
```

or via alias `$.r`:

``` javascript
$.r('login_form');
```

### With context

``` javascript
$.role('submit', loginForm); // To handle <a href="#" role="submit"></a> inside loginForm element
```
